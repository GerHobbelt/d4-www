        <strong>Howdy</strong>, this documentation is auto-generated using the comments from the source
        code. It is still very much in flux, and subject to change. If you merely
        want to know how to use d4, try the examples section. It is full of
        real-word <a href="/examples.html">examples</a> on how to use d4.
